        <h3>Psychological happiness:</h3>
        <h5>The overall model of mental health generally includes concepts based on educational, psychological,
          religious, and humanitarian ideas, in addition to theoretical ideas from personality psychology, social,
          clinical, health, and developmental psychology.</h5>
        <br>
        <br>

        <h3>The impact of Islam on mental health:</h3>
        <h5>Through its legislation, Islam seeks to purify the soul and rid it of the taints of evil and the
          inclinations of falsehood, thus making it sound, healthy, strong, and capable of positive action and societal
          reform, in preparation for the Muslim to be a good citizen.<br>

          On this basis, mental health is considered one of the highest goals of Islam, because of its role in reforming
          the individual and qualifying him to serve society in a way that brings him general benefit. Thus, the
          legislation intended to rid the person of everything that could make him a negative, useless individual.
          Mental health is achieved through several interconnected and inseparable things that complement each other,
          which we highlight as follows:</h5>

            <section>

              <li>Faith:</li>
              <p>Faith creates in the heart of a Muslim an absolute certainty of safety, comfort, and reassurance. With
                it, he is convinced that God is the One who directs the path, the Creator, the Sustainer, and the Guide
                to the straight path. In this situation, the Muslim only has to direct his attention and focus to what
                will bring general benefit to him and his society, away from the philosophy of pessimism and doubt, for
                everything that was and will be is destined by the one, individual, steadfast person.
                <br>
                <br>
                Faith in God and worshiping Him is the origin of tranquility, which is an unseen light cast into the
                heart, achieving a sense of balance. Faith, in its depth, is a feeling of being with God. Therefore, it
                is the most important reason for achieving psychological health, which is based on tranquility.</p>

              <li>The prayer: </li>
              <p>Prayer is considered the pillar and foundation of religion. Through it, a Muslim connects his
                connection with his Lord and finds relief from the fatigue of life (relieve us with it, O Bilal). In
                prayer, a person’s need for support from heaven is established to help him during his alienation in life
                and strengthen him to face the stormy waves of life. It is an ascension to the levels of sublimity, in
                which he feels... Man, in his humanity, also feels his worth and value, and that he is unable to live
                without divine abundance, divine light, and heavenly supplies that bring comfort to his soul.
                <br>
                Through prayer, a person avoids immorality and evil, and this leads to daily behavior that includes
                actions and words. This means that prayer’s effect and influence extends to refining the tongue and
                heart and everything related to them.
                <br>
                There are two strange paradoxes in prayer that come together in it alone: ​​the Muslim gets rid of
                negative energy, and mobilizes positive energy that strengthens him, and all of that is in prostration,
                recitation, supplication, and kneeling, and the more a Muslim bows down in worship, the higher he rises
                in elevation.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <li>The remembrance:</li>
              <p>Dhikr is a daily habit practiced by a Muslim. It charges him with positive energy from a hidden source,
                and infuses the soul with life and strength. With this worship, hearts find peace.
                {أَلا بِذِكْرِ اللَّهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ}
                By turning away from it, hearts harden, faces frown, and tempers harden: {وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي
                فَإنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا}
                <br>
                The remembrance of God is a sense of the constant presence of the Creator, and the request for support
                from Him at every moment, in which the uninterrupted connection continues once the prayer is completed.
                <br>
                The Qur’an is a healing balm for souls and hearts exhausted by the fatigue of life. After that, it is a
                divine medicine. By reading it, God speaks to you, and that is the gateway to heart tranquility that
                makes the soul become a lush paradise, and neglecting it turns the soul into a barren, desolate desert.
                <br>
                Through it, the connection with the Creator of the heavens is renewed and the breasts are healed, and in
                its rebukes and prohibitions it is a warning to the soul against the consequences of arrogance, tyranny,
                and harm. Thus, it performs an educational and educational act that buries the evil tendencies in the
                human soul, and thus achieves psychological health.</p>

            <section>
              <li>Fasting:</li>
              <p>Fasting is one of the finest acts of worship, through which the hot soul is tamed and bridled, and
                psychological serenity is achieved resulting from the comfort of the stomach and heart, and the
                subsequent ridding of the body of what is harmful. Fasting is the act of worship that most achieves
                psychological comfort and is dedicated to creating patience, contentment, and a feeling for others for
                the one who fasts out of devotion, not habit. It is a free clinic and a psychological sport</p>
            </section>

            <section>

              <li>Piety:</li>
              <p>Piety is an impenetrable wall that protects the believer from falling into everything that takes him
                away from the straight path. It is a protection and a heartfelt immunity against what is forbidden, and
                it is the way out of every calamity, distress, and fatigue that befalls a Muslim, and it also brings
                sustenance:{وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لا يَحْتَسِبُ},that
                is, it grants him health, well-being, and tranquility. Notice how he released the way out and
                sustenance, and did not restrict or specify it.</p>
