    WATER
  </h1>
 
  <h3>Benefits of water and its importance to the body:</h3>
  <p>All cells and organs of the body need water to carry out their normal functions in the best way.  The body performs basic functions in the human body,<br> and eating a sufficient amount of it results in the following benefits:</p>
 
  <ol>
    <li>Maintaining normal body temperature:</li> 
    <p>The water stored in the skin cells comes out to the outer surface of the skin in the form of sweat when the body temperature rises, and then evaporates, leading to lowering the body temperature and consequently feeling cold.</p>
   
    <li>Bone joint support:</li>
    <p>Water makes up about 80% of the cartilage inside the joints, and prolonged exposure to dehydration affects the joints ability to absorb shock, resulting in joint pain.</p>
   
      <li>Protecting the brain, spinal cord, and sensitive body tissues and providing them with the necessary support:</li>
      <p>Dehydration affects the structure and functions of the brain, and if it continues for a long time, it affects thinking and logical deduction.</p>
     
      <li>Waste disposal:</li>
      <li>By urination, sweating, and excretion.</li>
     
      <li>Water is involved in the formation of saliva and mucus, and saliva helps digest food and keeps the mouth, nose, and eyes moist.  Water also keeps the mouth clean and contributes to reducing the chance of tooth decay if consumed instead of sweetened moisturizers.</li>
     
      <li>Carrying oxygen in the blood to various organs of the body.</li>
     
      <li>Dissolving nutrients, making them easily reach various parts of the body.</li>
     
      <li>Promoting skin health and protecting it from skin problems and premature wrinkles resulting from dryness.  To maintain skin moisture, it is preferable to use moisturizing creams.</li>
     
      <li>Helping the intestines perform its function properly, preventing constipation, and protecting the stomach from excess acidity that leads to heartburn and ulcers.</li>
     
      <li>Maintaining normal blood pressure.</li>
     
      <li>Water is essential for the airways and protecting people with asthma and allergies from deteriorating their condition.</li>
     
      <li>Preventing damage to the kidneys, which are responsible for regulating fluids in the body. Insufficient water may lead to the formation of kidney stones and other kidney problems.</li>
     
      <li>Help lose weight:</li>
      <p>If it is consumed instead of soft drinks and sweetened juices.</p>
     
     
      <li>Increases metabolism and helps you feel full:</li>
    <p>When drinking water before meals, this prevents overeating and leads to weight loss. The best time to drink water is half an hour before a meal.</p>
   
    <li>Contributing to improving athletic performance, especially during strenuous exercise:</li>
    <p>It is recommended to drink about half a liter of water or fluids before exercising, in addition to drinking water shortly after starting exercises and repeating this at regular intervals to compensate for fluids lost through sweating.</p>
   
    <li>Prevention of headaches and relieving severity in people with dehydration.</li>

    <li>Water and Kidney Functions:</li>
    <p>-Water is essential for the kidneys to function properly. It dissolves the nutrients needed by the body and works to deliver them to the cells and tissues. It also helps the body get rid of waste.  If you do not drink enough water for the kidneys to do their role in regulating fluids, waste will accumulate inside your body, and fluids will accumulate abnormally inside the body.  If the situation continues like this and is not treated, the kidney damage may develop into kidney failure and the patient will need either dialysis or a kidney transplant.  Chronic kidney disease leads to complications such as anemia, central nervous system damage, a weakened immune system, and heart failure.
      <br> <br>
     - Many people suffer from kidney stones, and not drinking enough water is one of the most prominent causes. Kidney stones increase the risk of developing chronic kidney disease, and also make it difficult to treat urinary tract infections if they develop them.  To reduce the chance of developing kidney stones again by half, the American College of Physicians recommends increasing drinking water so that the volume of urine excreted by the body daily becomes 2 liters.
      <br> <br>
     - Drinking plenty of water also reduces the risk of urinary tract infections and helps treat them if they occur.
      <br> <br>
     - In addition to the role of the kidneys in regulating fluids, they are also responsible for regulating the level of ions in the body. Potassium ions, phosphate and sodium are responsible for carrying electrical signals between cells. Epilepsy, involuntary muscle movement, and loss of consciousness.
      <br> <br>
      -Remember that the more you keep drinking enough water, the kidneys will do their job in cleaning your body and ridding it of waste and toxins to the fullest. him.
